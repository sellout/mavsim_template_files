# mavsim template files

Template files for mavsim, the simulator developed in [_Small Unmanned Aircraft: Theory and Practice_](http://uavbook.byu.edu/doku.php).

There are three implementations of the simulator to build on, each one has its own README indicating how to build and use that particular implementation.

- [MATLAB](./mavsim_matlab/README.md)
- [Python](./mavsim_python/README.md)
- [Simulink](./mavsim_simulink/README.md)
